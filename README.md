CMSC388V Final Project: Low Pass Filter

## Background

In my initial proposal, i have mentioned that my final project will aim towards removing noise using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), which i initially planned to do. However, based on the instructor's feedback on my proposal and my own research on this topic, the project seems a lot harder to implement than i thought of. The challenge here was to be able to work with a realtime audio source, which would make the computation of the FTT a bit hard.

Hence, i have tried something simpler which was to use low-pass filter on `.wav` format audio files where
